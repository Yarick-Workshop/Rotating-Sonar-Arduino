# Rotating Sonar Arduino
Set of Arduino programs (aka sketches) for an HC-SR04-like ultrasonic distance sensor (aka Sonar). The sonar can be directed in different directions using a servo motor. The author used cheap SG90 servo but it can be any except continuous rotation servo motors. 

‚ö†Ô∏è **In case of any questions** ‚Äì do not hesitate to contact the author in Telegram group ([see below](#contact-me)) and ask.

## List of sketches
The project started as a part of my out of trash made robot: https://t.me/YarickWorkshop/630. But I have a plan to write much more sketches with other "tasty" functionality.
